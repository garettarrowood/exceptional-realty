h1. Fake Realty Website

p. This static website was built by following a series of well crafted code-along tutorials by "Jonathan Grover":https://github.com/jongrover. If you'd like to access his step by step breakdown, enroll in the "Flatiron School's Part-time Frontend Curriculum":http://flatironschool.com/frontend.html in NYC.

Having extremely little Front-End knowledge, I gained a solid foundation in:

* HTML
* CSS
* Responsive Design
* Integrating and Customizing Bootstrap
* DOM
* Javascript
* jQuery
* And the list will go on, as I have much more to learn as I finish his course...
